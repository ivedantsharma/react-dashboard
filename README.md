# Alert Data Visualization Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Alert Data Visualization Dashboard is a web application designed to provide real-time insights into network alerts and events. The application retrieves alert data from a JSON file and presents it in an intuitive format using charts and visualizations. Users can filter the data based on specific time ranges, such as the last hour or the last day, making it easier to monitor network activity and identify potential security threats.

## Features

- **Alert Data Display**: Displays alerts from a JSON data source.
- **Time Range Filters**: Filters alerts based on the last hour and last day.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents data in chart format for better understanding and analysis.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on various devices with a user-friendly interface.
